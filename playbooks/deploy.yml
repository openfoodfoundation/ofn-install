# Deploy a release or other branch on a server
#
# This playbook will create a new folder to build the app with Ruby and JS dependencies, and swap
# over for a (relatively) seamless update.
#
# git_version: specify a git ref for the openfoodnetwork codebase (default is master). Eg:
#  -e "git_version=v3.7.0"
#
# github_key: specify a forked branch instead. Eg:
#  -e "github_key=jibees:upgrade-node-version"
