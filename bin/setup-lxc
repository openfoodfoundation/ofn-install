# Set up Linux Containers (LXC)
#
# If you don't run Linux, you better look at Vagrant to set up virtual machines.
#
# But if you run Linux anyway then you can use LXC to run virtual machines on
# the same kernel instead of creating a full virtual machine.
#
# Installation in Debian:
#
#   sudo apt install lxd
#   sudo lxd init
#   sudo usermod -aG lxd "$USER"
#   # Restart your user's session to gain the new group privilege.
#
# You may also like to look at Lexi to manage your LXC containers:
#
#   https://github.com/libre-ops/lexi
