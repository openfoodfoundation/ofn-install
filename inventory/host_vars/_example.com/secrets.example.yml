# Example settings for integrations like Zapier.
# ----------------------------------------------
# Generate a strong password with this command: `openssl rand -hex 128`.
#
# You can add one or multiple entries using the lists (with dashes), then run
# the `db_integrations.yml` playbook on the target server. Then, provision the
# server for the changes on the datadog agent to take place.
#
# To disable an integration, change the `state` key from `present` to: `absent`,
# remove the custom_* entries, then run the db_integrations.yml playbook again.

#db_integrations:
#  - { user: zapier, state: present, password: incredibly_strong_password_goes_here }


# For Datadog you will need the following:
#
#datadog_db_password: secure_password_goes_here
#
#db_integrations:
#  - { user: datadog, state: present, password: "{{ datadog_db_password }}" }
