# This suite runs through some key scenarios with ofn-install's core playbooks, and performs some
# rudimentary tests to make sure the playbooks are actually working as intended. This can be run
# from a CI build, or in a local VM/container environment.

# Setup, provision, and deploy on a fresh install

# Deploying to a live instance
- import_playbook: ../tests/deploy/setup.yml

# Perform a rollback
- import_playbook: ../tests/rollback/setup.yml

# Simulate transitional deployment to instance with old deployment method
- import_playbook: ../tests/transitional_deploy/setup.yml

# Perform another rollback after transition
- import_playbook: ../tests/rollback/setup.yml

# Deploy a second time after transition
